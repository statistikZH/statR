\usage{
quick_sum(df, var, ..., stats = "all", protect = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe}

\item{var}{variables to be aggregated}

\item{...}{grouping variables}

\item{stats}{Which descriptive statistics should be computed? Can be "all",
"base", or "mean". See details.}

\item{protect}{Apply data protection, can be TRUE or FALSE. See details.}
}
\description{
Function for simple (grouped) descriptive analyses.
}
\details{
If stats is set to "all" (the default), the following descriptive
 statistics are computed per category of the grouping variable(s): mean,
 standard deviation, 10\%-quantile, 25\%-quantile, median, 75\%-quantile,
 90\%-quantile.

 If stats is set to "base", the mean, 25\%-quantile, median, and 75\%-quantile
 are returned.

 stats = "mean" computes the mean and the standard deviation.

 If protect is set to TRUE, the mean and the median is only computed for
 variables/variable categories with four or more observations. For <4
 observations, the function returns NA for the respective variable/category.
 The other descriptives are only computed if there are at least 6 observations
 per variable (category).
